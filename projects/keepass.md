## KeePass Password Manager

KeePassXC is a free, open source and self hostable password manager database software. Passwords are kept in an encrypted file. The file is navigated with a UI and supports folders for greater organization.

The following steps detail KeePassXC configuration:

1. **Install KeePassXC**
(https://keepassxc.org) Do not use the old KeePass 2.x; KeePassXC is modern and cross-platform.
2. **Create Password Database**
After opening KeePassXC, click Database in the top left corner and select New Database. A strong Master Password will be required, used to unlock/decrypt the encrypted database file every time it is accessed. Best practice is to save the file in a dedicated folder in the NAS: nasshare/passwords/passwords.kdbx
3. **Populate**
Add all your passwords to the database. Add folders to organize your passwords by clicking Groups (top menu bar), then New Group. Click Entries (top menu bar) and New Entry to add a Title, Username and Password. They should be saved automatically.

To access your passwords, find and open the database file. Then enter your master password to decrypt the file.
